# Basic Syntax of MongoDB

## Structure
*Assume we have a DB `blog` and collections `posts` and `comments` data structure look like:*

``` sql
posts {
    "_id" : ObjectId("5f5f3f52e9522dfdab884f6c"),
        "title" : "My first post!",
        "text" : "This is my first post, hope you will enjoy it.",
        "tags" : [
                "new",
                "tech"
        ],
        "create": 2020-07-29T13:17:08.868+00:00,
        "update": 2020-07-29T13:17:08.868+00:00,
        "like": 12, 
        "creator" : ObjectId("5f5f3ea1e9522dfdab884f6b"),
        "comments" : [
                {
                        "text" : "I like this post",
                        "author" : ObjectId("5f5f3ea1e9522dfdab884f6a"),
                        "like":1,
                        "create": 2020-07-29T13:17:40.868+00:00,
                        "update": 2020-07-29T13:17:40.868+00:00,
                },
                {
                        "text" : "Thank you",
                        "author" : ObjectId("5f5f3f52e9522dfdab884f6c"),
                        "like":2,
                        "create": 2020-07-29T13:17:49.868+00:00,
                        "update": 2020-07-29T13:17:49.868+00:00,
                }
        ]
}
```
***
## Create method
* *Create many `posts`:*

1. With `{ ordered: true }`:
```sql
// By default ordered = true 
db.posts.insertMany([
        {"title" : "My second post!", ...},
        {"title" : "My second post!",...}, 
        {"title" : "My third post!",...},
        {"title" : "My fourth post!",...},
        ...
])
```
and an *duplicate error* will be raised and others posts below that duplicate object (third post, fourth post,...) won't be inserted.
2. With `{ ordered: false }`:
```sql
db.posts.insertMany([
        {"title" : "My second post!", ...},
        {"title" : "My second post!",...}, 
        {"title" : "My third post!",...},
        {"title" : "My fourth post!",...},
        ...
], { ordered: false })
```
and an *duplicate error* will still be raised but all posts which aren't duplicate are inserted. 
***

## Read method.

* *To find all `posts`:*
``` SQL
db.posts.find()
```

* *To find `posts` with matching field(s):*
```SQL
db.posts.find({_id: ObjectId("<id object>")})
```

* *To find with conditions:*
```SQL
db.posts.find({likes: {$gt: 5}})
```
and the same with `$lt`, `$gte`, `$lte`, `$eq`, `$ne`, `$in`, `$nin`.

* *To query embedded documents:*
```SQL
 db.posts.find({"comments.author": ObjectId("<id object>)})
```

* *To query with logical condition:*
```SQL
 db.posts.find({ $or: [ { quantity: { $lt: 20 } }, { price: 10 } ] })
```
and the same with `$and`, `$nor`, `$not`.

* *Check a condition for a field:*
```SQL
db.posts.find({likes: {$exists: true, $gt: 5}})
```
or find that field which is not null:
```SQL
db.posts.find({likes: {$exists: true, $ne: null}})
```
or find a field having a specific type 
```SQL
db.posts.find({ field: { $type: <type1>} })
```
*or even an array of types of data accepted for checking a field's type is one in array*
```SQL
db.posts.find({ field: { $type: [ <BSON type1>; , <BSON type2>, ... ] } })
```

* *Query with evaluation:*
        *1. Find posts which haven't been update (Create equal to update date)*
        ```       
        db.posts.find( { $expr: { $eq: [ "$create" , "$update" ] } } )
        ```
        *2. Find posts which having word "first" in it's title with `regex`*
        ```
        db.posts.find({title: {$regex: /first/ }})
        ```
        *3. And so on...*
<br>

* *Query with skip and limit.*
**Note:** *These ways below give **the same** result.*
``` SQL
db.posts.find().sort({likes: 1, create: -1}).skip(10).limit(5)
```
```SQL
db.posts.find().skip(10).limit(5).sort({likes: 1, create: -1})
```

* *Find `posts` having both tags:*
``` SQL
// This will find all posts having tag "tech" and "new"
db.posts.find({tags: {$all: ["tech", "new"]}})
```

* ***Projection in MongoDB:***

*Definition:*
> The positional $ operator limits the contents of an <array> to return either:
> * The first element that matches the query condition on the array.
> * The first element if no query condition is specified for the array (Starting in MongoDB 4.4).

*Syntax*
1. Case projection with `$elemMatch`:
```SQL
db.posts.find({like: {$gt: 12}}, {tags: {$elemMatch: {$eq: "tech"}}})
```
and the result will look like:
``` sql
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5f5f3f52e9522dfdab884f6c"), "tags" : [ "tech" ] }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5f64638adff26b47940f06d6") }
```
> *"The filter and the projection can be not related to each other, it's totally normal. However, with `$` operator, it have to filter and projection on the same field."* - Some trainer of an online MongoDB course.

2. Case projection with `$`:
```sql
db.posts.find({tags: {$eq: "new"}}, {"tags.$":1})
```
and the result will look like:
``` sql
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5f5f3f52e9522dfdab884f6c"), "tags" : [ "new" ] }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5f64638adff26b47940f06d6"), "tags" : [ "new" ] }
```
*A little note:*
```sql
db.posts.find({tags: {$all: ["tech", "new"]}}, {"tags.$":1})
```
will return the result looked like:
``` sql
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5f5f3f52e9522dfdab884f6c"), "tags" : [ "new" ] }

// object 5f64638adff26b47940f06d6 doesn't have "tech" in tags
```
> *"Because mongo will make a check through all the array ["tech","new"], the result which element has "tech" in it's tags would be compared to which element has "new" in it's tags so **the first matching element** (as definition above) is "new", not "tech"." - Some trainer of an online MongoDB course.*

:exclamation: *Concluding*: 
* *We should consider between using `elemMatch` and`$` operator, we can take a look at docs below:*
> "The `$elemMatch`projection operator takes an explicit condition argument. This allows you to project based on a condition not in the query, or if you need to project based on multiple fields in the arrayâ€™s embedded documents."

> "The `$` operator projects the first matching array element from each document in a collection based on some condition from the query statement."
* *A little note above is worth to keep in mind.*
***

## Update method.
* *Update field's value:*
```sql
db.posts.updateOne({_id: ObjectId("<id object>")}, {$set: {like: 2}})
```
or use `$unset` to **delete** fields and it's values:
```sql
db.posts.updateOne(
        {_id: ObjectId("<id object>")}, {$unset: {title: "", text: ""}}
)
```
* *Update increase or decrease a field's value:*
```sql
db.posts.updateOne({_id: ObjectId("<id object>")}, {$inc: {like: 2}})
```
and decrease with negative value: `{$inc: {like: -2}}`
* *Other update options:*

Name | Purpose | Syntax
-----|---------|--------
`$min` |Get the lowest value and set to the field which being updated. | `db.posts.updateOne({_id: ObjectId("<id object>")}, {$min: {like: 2}})`
`$max` |Get the highest value and set to the field which being updated. | `db.posts.updateOne({_id: ObjectId("<id object>")}, {$max: {like: 2}})`
`$mul` |Multiply the value of a field by a number. If `$mul` a field doesn't exist, result would be 0 and having the same numeric type.| `db.posts.updateOne({_id: ObjectId("<id object>")}, {$mul: {like: 2}})`

* *Updating all elements in array:*
```sql
// Increase 1 to field "like" of every object "comment" in array "comments"
db.collection.updateOne(
   {"_id" : ObjectId("<id object>")}, {$inc: {"comments.$[].like:" : 1}}
)
```
* *Insert a element to an array.*
```sql
// Insert and sort by ascending create date order
db.collection.updateOne(
   {"_id" : ObjectId("<id object>")}, 
   {$push: 
        {"comments": 
                {$each: [{
                        "text" : "I really like this post",
                        "author" : ObjectId("5f5f3ea1e9522dfdab884f6a"),
                        "like":0,
                        create: 2020-07-29T13:17:50.868+00:00,
                        update: 2020-07-29T13:17:50.868+00:00
                },
                {
                        "text" : "Thank you again",
                        "author" : ObjectId("5f5f3f52e9522dfdab884f6c"),
                        "like":0,
                        create: 2020-07-29T13:17:52.868+00:00,
                        update: 2020-07-29T13:17:52.868+00:00
                }]
        }
   }},
   {$sort: {create: -1}}, 
   $slice: 3,
)
```
Options of `$push`:
Name | Purpose | Syntax
-----|---------|--------
`$slice`|Limits the number of array elements. Requires the use of the $each modifier.| `$slice: 3` (No { })
`$position`|Specific a position to when pushing element to array.| `$position:4` (No { })

***NOTE:*** *Use `$addToSet` instead of `$push`if value inserted need to be unique.*
<br>

* *Removing element(s) from array:*
```sql
// remove with text|| condition
db.collection.updateOne(
   {"_id" : ObjectId("<id object>")}, {$pop: {comments: "thank you again"}}
)

//Or remove the last element (remove the first with {comments: -1})
db.collection.updateOne(
   {"_id" : ObjectId("<id object>")}, {$pop: {comments: 1}}
)
```
***NOTE:*** *If you work more on array, you should learn how to use arrayFilter*

***
## Delete Method.
* *Removing documents with more than 2 conditions:*
```sql
// remove many with conditions
db.collection.deleteMany(
   {likes: {$eq: 0}}, 
   {create: {$lt: 2020-07-29T13:17:08.868+00:00}},
   {creator: {$exists: false}}
)
```

## Advanced things.
* *Indexes in MongoDB:* 

**Note 1:** Threshold for memory in MongoDB is 32 megabytes for sorting, in case of large documents, having `index` is a smart way to low the usage of memory for sorting because Mongo take all docs in it's own memory and sort elements in there. 

**Note 2:** Using `index` having lots of benefits such as the fastest way to query or helping to reduce the usage of memories indicated above. However, it's important to use `index` at the right time and in the right place. 
For example: Looking for a `post` with it's title, collection should be create `index` with field `title` BUT looking for a `post` which having `create` before 07/29/2020 and having more than 10 `like` then `index` should be create on field `create`

**Note 3:** Create `index` on every single field will give us super fast query but it costs much more time whenever insert/update documents due to the creation/update of `index` for every field in the document.

**Note 4:** `index` are unique. If a field was nominated to be index, null/empty/not exist is still a value, which mean if two documents both having null/empty/not exist value for nominated field would raise a `duplicate error`.
